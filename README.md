# Welcome to CodeING

## :arrow_forward: Introduction

CodeING is an offer of the youth talent network 'Young Engineers' of the Assocation of German Engineers.
From Engineers for Engineers is our motto.

Software Engineers provide exercises (called Dojos) to teach basic and advanced programming skills and a following chapter as introduction into software architecture.

## :arrow_forward: Prerequisites

- no prerequisites

Our target is to provide easy understandable topic dojos to guide you throught the learning steps for the programming language TypeScript.

## :arrow_forward: Executive Schedule

Format: weekly coding dojos with some basic descriptions, code examples and exercises for practical learning.
Effort: (planned) max. 2h/week - at the beginning rather less, with increasing complexity the effort also increases
Support: exercise description, code examples, literature links, Q&A channels on github
Validation: at the end of each topic week, a short video from the topic lead will be provided.

If required, live sessions can also be organized to check the exercises and results.
