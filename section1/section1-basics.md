# Section 1 - Basic Software Programming

In this section we will give you an introduction to basic programming concepts in Type Script.

## :arrow_forward: S1D0 - Setting up your IDE and some basics
Lead: @Blumi102 (Michelle Blumenstein)


This first dojo will be about getting all the basics in place so that you can start programming. We'll show you what software you need, how to install it and how to configure it. We'll also give you some helpful tips and tricks about the development environment and how we collaborate with each other in the Coding Dojos.

The following topics will be addressed:

- Installation and configuration of VS Code as well as the necessary extensions
- Implementation of your first Hello World program
- Commenting your program
- Installation, setup and usage of git and GitHub
- Tips and tricks for our collaboration in the Coding Dojos




## :arrow_forward: S1D1 - Types and Variables
Lead: @Blumi102 (Michelle Blumenstein)

In this Coding Dojo we will give you an introduction to variables and the type system of TypeScript. 

The following topics will be addressed:

- Declaration of variables using 'var', 'let' and 'const'
- Scopes of variables (function-scope, global-scope, class-scope)
- Introduction to the type system in TypeScript consisting of Any Type, Built-in Types and User-defined types and when to use them
- Working with numbers, booleans, strings, enums and void
- Working with Any und Unknown
- Working with Null und Undefined
- Naming conventions for variables

## :arrow_forward: S1D2 - Control Flows and Functions
Lead: @Blumi102 (Michelle Blumenstein)

In addition to variables, TypeScript programs also consist of control flow statements, expression and functions. In this dojos we will give you an insight into those constructs.

The following topics will be addressed:

- Introduction of if statements
- Introduction of switch statements
- Introduction of for loops
- Introduction of while loops
- Introduction of functions, their declaration and expressions
- Usage of 'this'

## :arrow_forward: S1D3 - Classes and Interfaces
Lead: @stan1025 (Andreas Stutz)

After the introduction of types and variables as well as control flows and functions, the next step is to learn something about classes and interfaces.

The following topics will be adressed:
- Introduction into Classes
- Differences between Objects and Classes
- Introduction to Interfaces
- INtroduction to Interface Segregation

## :arrow_forward: S1D4 - Inheritance and Type Checking
Lead: @stan1025 (Andreas Stutz)

Next to classes and interfaces, inheritance and type checking are also some basic construct from the paradigm of object-oriented programming.
In this Dojo basic topics into class inheritance and type checking is given.

The following topics will be adressed:
- Introduction to Inheritance
- Introduction to abstract classes
- Introduction to Type and Instance Checking
- Introduction of the 'as' operator
- Introduction of the '< >' notation
